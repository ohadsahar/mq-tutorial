##Getting Started

In this tutorial I will explain how to operate the app briefly.

##RabbitMq - Message Queue

If you have rabbit mq already installed you can skip those steps and move to the next guide.

First, Open the terminal and run this command:

Mac:

```bash
brew install rabbitmq
```

Windows:

```bash
choco install rabbitmq
```

Second, Run the service:

Mac:

```bash
brew services start rabbitmq
```

##App Guide

Before we begin, I spared you the activation of your Mongo and the preoccupation with inserting the login string, etc., and you are directly connected to the cluster I opened that is open to everyone, so the guide to using this app is very simple.

First, you need to run the next command:

```bash
npm i
```

Second, run the Freshstart:

```bash
npm run freshstart
```

After running the command above you will have the ads that we need for our app
(you can add by yourself more ads with the postman that i shared in code(you can check it on postman folder)).

Third, Abort the terminal and run the next command:

```bash
npm run run-ts
```

## Guid is over, Enjoy from the app:)
